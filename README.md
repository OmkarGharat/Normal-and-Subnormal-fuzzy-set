# Normal-and-Subnormal-fuzzy-set
A python program to check whether given fuzzy set is normal fuzzy set or subnormal fuzzy set

## Normal fuzzy set : 

If height of fuzzy set is 1 , then it is a normal fuzzy set.

# What is a Fuzzy Set ??

There are 2 terms we need to understand before understanding fuzzy set i.e. fuzzy and crisp

1. fuzzy : Fuzzy means the things whose answers are not perfect or not specific.
  eg. How good player Virat Kohli is ?? 
  some say, he is best , some say good , some say average. 
 
2. crisp : Crisp means value should be perfect and accurate.
  eg. How many runs Virat Kohli scored today ??
  runs scored = 113 , so you can't say like he scored a lot of runs or more than 100 runs. Your answer must pe accurate and perfect.

So , 

### fuzzy set is the set of fuzzy values or values that are not specific.
